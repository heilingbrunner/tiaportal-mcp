# Change Log

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-11

Generate TIA Portal external source files - the format the compiler reads back - from blocks and
PLC data types. The read tool surface grows from 56 to 59.

### Added

- __`GenerateBlockSource`__: writes one program block as an external source file. The extension
  is dictated by the object, not chosen by the caller: `.db` for data blocks, `.awl` for STL
  blocks, `.scl` for SCL blocks. Openness throws on a mismatch, so the mapping is derived rather
  than passed in. Data blocks are recognised by type instead of by `ProgrammingLanguage`, because
  the DB family spans several language values (`DB`, `CPU_DB`, `F_DB`, `Motion_DB`) that all
  write `.db`.
- __`GenerateTypeSource`__: writes one PLC data type as a `*.udt` external source file. Unlike
  `GetTypeSource` and `ExportTypeAsDocuments` this needs no TIA Portal V21, and the result can be
  imported again.
- __`GenerateSources`__: the comfort function - writes every block and PLC data type of one PLC
  software into a folder tree that mirrors the project groups, `<exportPath>/Program blocks/...`
  and `<exportPath>/PLC data types/...`, one file per object. Accepts `regexName` to narrow the
  set. This is the compilable counterpart to `ExportPlcAsSourceTree`, which snapshots the same
  tree as source documents and XML.
- All three take `withDependencies`, which maps to `GenerateOptions.WithDependencies` and pulls
  every object the subject uses - called blocks, instance DBs, UDTs - into the same file, so it
  compiles on its own. Off by default, which keeps one object per file and therefore a tree that
  diffs cleanly.

### Notes

- Openness generates sources only from data blocks and STL or SCL blocks. LAD, FBD, GRAPH and the
  rest have no textual form: the single-object tools reject them with the reason and a pointer to
  `ExportBlock` or `ExportAsDocuments`, and `GenerateSources` reports them in `Skipped` rather
  than failing the whole run. Inconsistent and know-how protected objects are handled the same
  way.
- Openness treats an existing file at the target path as an error, not an overwrite. Every other
  exporter in this server overwrites, so the target file is deleted first and a second run
  succeeds instead of failing.
- Filesystem only: generating a source does not modify the project, so these tools are not gated
  behind `--allow-write`. They are marked destructive, like the `Export*` tools, because they
  overwrite files.
- New files: `Siemens/Portal.GenerateSource.cs` and
  `ModelContextProtocol/McpServer.GenerateSource.cs`, kept apart from the `*.Source.cs` pair,
  which deals in source documents and SimaticML rather than in compilable sources.

### Added (write side)

- __`ImportSources`__: the bulk-import counterpart to `GenerateSources`. Walks a folder tree of
  `.db`/`.awl`/`.scl`/`.udt` files and compiles each back into a block or PLC data type, placed
  into the group its folder path implies - the same layout `GenerateSources` writes. Requires
  `--allow-write`, since unlike the `Generate*` tools this mutates the project.
- Each file goes through the two Openness steps there is no shortcut around: register it as a
  scratch `PlcExternalSource` (reusing the existing `CreateExternalSourceFromFile`), call
  `PlcExternalSource.GenerateBlocksFromSource` - which returns a mix of `PlcBlock` and `PlcType`
  objects from a single file, since the source's own content decides what comes out - then
  delete the scratch source again (reusing `DeleteExternalSource`), regardless of outcome.
- `keepOnError` maps to `GenerateBlockOption.KeepOnError`: successfully generated objects from a
  file are kept even when others in the same file fail. Openness gives up per-object
  success/failure reporting in that mode, which is a limitation of the underlying API, not of
  this wrapper.
- A folder whose implied group does not exist in the project fails that one file (reported in
  `Failures`) rather than being created automatically; the group structure is expected to
  already exist, since these files were themselves generated from objects that lived in it.
- New files: `Siemens/Portal.ImportSources.cs` and
  `ModelContextProtocol/McpServerWrite.ImportSources.cs`. Reuses
  `GetPlcBlockGroupByPath`/`GetPlcTypeGroupByPath` and the private `StripSystemRootSegment`
  helper (`Portal.Documents.cs`) rather than re-deriving the same "does this folder name match
  the localized system root" logic a third time.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-10

Complete the PLC software area of the Openness API: tags, constants, watch and force tables,
external sources, cross references, and create/rename/delete/move for blocks and types. The tool
surface grows from 31 tools to 44 read tools plus 37 project-mutating tools.

### Added

- __Write mode__, opt-in through the new `--allow-write` command line argument. The 37
  project-mutating tools live in a separate `McpServerWrite` tool type that is only registered
  when the flag is present, so without it they are absent from `tools/list` rather than merely
  refused when called. `WritePolicy.EnsureEnabled` additionally guards every write tool at
  runtime, because these are `public static` methods that the test suite invokes directly and
  that path bypasses tool registration. Filesystem-only exports are deliberately not gated: they
  never modify the project. Both `GetState` and the `--doctor` report now show `AllowWrite`.
- __PLC tags and constants__: `GetTagTables`, `GetTagTableInfo`, `GetTags`, `GetTagInfo`,
  `GetConstants` (user and/or system) and `ExportTagTable`. Write side: `CreateTagTable`,
  `DeleteTagTable`, `RenameTagTable`, `CreateTagTableGroup`, `DeleteTagTableGroup`,
  `ImportTagTable`, `CreateTag`, `UpdateTag`, `DeleteTag`, `CreateUserConstant`,
  `UpdateUserConstant`, `DeleteUserConstant`.
- __Watch and force tables__: `GetWatchTables`, `GetWatchTableInfo` (including entries),
  `GetForceTables` and `ExportWatchTable`. Write side: `CreateWatchTable`, `RenameWatchTable`,
  `DeleteWatchTable`, `CreateWatchTableGroup`, `DeleteWatchTableGroup`, `ImportWatchTable`.
- __External source files__: `GetExternalSources`, `GetExternalSourceInfo`,
  `CreateExternalSourceFromFile`, `DeleteExternalSource`, `CreateExternalSourceGroup`,
  `DeleteExternalSourceGroup` and `GenerateBlocksFromSource`.
- __Cross references__: `GetCrossReferences` for a whole PLC software or for one block, type,
  tag table, tag or block group. Because `Sources -> References -> Locations` nests three deep
  and source children recurse, the tool takes `maxDepth` (default 1, maximum 3) and reports a
  `Truncated` flag with counts instead of returning megabytes.
- __Blocks and types__: `CreateBlockGroup`, `DeleteBlockGroup`, `CreateTypeGroup`,
  `DeleteTypeGroup`, `DeleteBlock`, `RenameBlock`, `DeleteType`, `RenameType`, `CreateFB`,
  `CreateInstanceDB`, plus `CopyBlock`, `MoveBlock`, `CopyType` and `MoveType`.
- `Portal.GetTypePath(PlcType)`, the counterpart to `GetBlockPath(PlcBlock)`.
- `Operation.Run`, the single exception-decoration point that `docs/error-model.md` prescribes.
  It wraps a non-`PortalException` into one, stamps context into `Exception.Data`, logs once
  (nested calls do not re-log) and rethrows. It also serializes all Openness traffic behind a
  `Monitor`; a `SemaphoreSlim` would self-deadlock, because portal methods call one another.
- `PortalErrorCode` gains `ImportFailed`, `CreateFailed`, `DeleteFailed`, `RenameFailed`,
  `NotSupported` and `WriteDisabled`. Existing members keep their order and values.

- __PLC data types as SIMATIC Source Documents__ (TIA Portal V21+): `ExportTypeAsDocuments` and
  `ExportTypesAsDocuments`, plus the write-gated `ImportTypeFromDocuments` and
  `ImportTypesFromDocuments`. Until now only program blocks could be written as documents - the
  readable, git-diffable form where `<Name>.s7dcl` holds the SCL/LAD source text and the
  optional `<Name>.s7res` the comments; every other export produced SimaticML XML. Openness only
  added `PlcType.ExportAsDocuments` and `PlcTypeComposition.ImportFromDocuments` in V21, hence
  the higher version gate than the V20 block tools. Tag tables and watch tables have no document
  API in V21 and remain XML-only.
  File names come from TIA Portal rather than from a hardcoded extension: an export reports the
  files it actually wrote (`DocumentExportResult.ExportedDocuments`, unioned with what is on
  disk) and a batch import discovers a document set by base name across a known extension set.
  Deleting a previous export stays restricted to `.s7dcl`/`.s7res`, so a hand-written `.scl` or
  `.udt` in the same directory is never removed.
  Unlike `ExportBlocksAsDocuments`, which only logs its failures, the bulk type export returns
  its inconsistent and failed types so the response can name them. The two type import tools sit
  in the `--allow-write` surface, where project-mutating tools belong; the older
  `ImportFromDocuments` and `ImportBlocksFromDocuments` remain ungated, which is a known
  inconsistency in those block tools rather than a pattern the new tools follow.

- __Ten comfort tools__ that shorten the path between a question and an answer. All read-only
  except where noted, and none change an existing tool's contract.
  - `GetBlockSource` / `GetTypeSource` return an object's source text inline instead of making
    the caller export a file and open it. Openness has no in-memory block body, so the readers
    export into a temp scratch directory and remove it again. STL and mixed-language blocks
    have no SIMATIC Source Document at all, so those fall back to XML and say so in `Format`.
  - `GetBlockInterface` lists a data block's members from `DataBlock.Interface` without any
    export, and works on inconsistent blocks. Data blocks only - V21 Openness offers no
    interface accessor for FB, FC or OB.
  - `FindInCode` searches the program text with a regular expression. Every other filter in the
    server matches object names only.
  - `CompileSoftware` now returns the whole `CompilerResult.Messages` tree flattened to
    `{path, state, description}` with error and warning counts, instead of one stringified
    sentence. Warnings are a successful compile with detail; only errors fail the call.
  - `GetPlcSummary` replaces six discovery calls: counts per area, a programming-language
    histogram, and the inconsistent and know-how-protected objects.
  - `WhereUsed` answers "what uses this?" from a bare name, flattening the cross-reference tree.
  - `ResolveObjectPath` turns a bare or partial name into the root-relative path the other tools
    need, across all six object areas. The `Path` property is also no longer commented out on
    `ResponseBlockInfo` and `ResponseTypeInfo`, so `GetBlocks` and `GetTypes` finally return
    round-trippable paths - exporting one type is now one call instead of three.
  - `OpenTiaProject` connects, opens and returns the device and PLC software paths in one call.
  - `ExportPlcAsSourceTree` snapshots a whole PLC to a git-ready folder tree in one call.
  - `PreviewImport` reports what an import would create, overwrite or collide with, without
    touching the project - including the PLC-global data type name rule.
- __Atomic, undoable writes.__ Every one of the write tools now runs inside
  `ExclusiveAccess.Transaction`, so a tool call commits as a unit and appears in the TIA Portal
  undo stack as one named entry. A body that throws rolls back instead of leaving the project
  half-edited (verified against a live V21). If TIA Portal refuses exclusive access the write
  still runs unwrapped, so this can never turn a working write into a failure.

### Changed

- `GetSoftwareTree` renders three further sections - PLC tags, watch and force tables, and
  external source files - and takes a `sections` argument accepting any comma separated subset
  of `blocks,types,tags,watch,sources` (default `all`) so the output stays manageable on a large
  PLC. Existing single-argument callers are unaffected.
- `Portal` and `McpServer` are now `partial` and split by area (`Portal.Tags.cs`,
  `Portal.WatchTables.cs`, `Portal.MoveCopy.cs`, `McpServer.Tags.cs`, ...). The generic path
  helpers in `Portal.Resolve.cs` (`WalkGroups`, `BuildGroupPath`, `WalkRecursive`) now back the
  existing block and type resolvers as well, so all five group hierarchies share one traversal.
- `Diagnostics.Run` takes an optional `bool allowWrite`. The flag is passed in rather than read
  from `WritePolicy`, so the Siemens layer keeps no dependency on the MCP layer.
- 27 read tools and all 37 write tools publish an `outputSchema` and return `structuredContent`
  (previously 13).

### Fixed

- The software tree omitted external source files even though the `GetSoftwareTree` description
  had always promised them.
- `GetBlockPath` returned paths prefixed with the `Program blocks` system group, which
  `GetBlock` then rejected - so the "Did you mean ...?" suggestions on a failed `ExportBlock`
  named paths that could not be used. Path building now takes an `includeSystemRoot` flag:
  suggestions are root-relative and round-trip, while `preservePath` exports keep the existing
  on-disk layout unchanged.
- `ExportTagTable` with `preservePath` wrote the group structure directly below `exportPath`,
  while block and type exports place theirs below the system folder (`Program blocks`,
  `PLC data types`). Tag tables now land in `<exportPath>/PLC tags/...`, using the system group
  name as TIA Portal reports it in the current interface language. `ImportTagTable` accepts a
  leading `PLC tags` segment in `groupPath` so the exported layout can be fed straight back.
- `--doctor --allow-write` reported write mode as disabled. `WritePolicy.AllowWrite` was only
  assigned inside `RunStdioHost`, which `--doctor` returns before reaching; it is now set in
  `Main`.

### Known gaps

- `CreateWatchTableEntry` and `DeleteWatchTableEntry` are not implemented. `PlcWatchTable.Entries`
  is a `PlcTableCommentEntryComposition` whose only typed creator produces a comment row; a real
  entry requires the untyped `IEngineeringComposition.Create(typeof(PlcWatchTableEntry), ...)`
  path, whose required attribute names must first be read from `GetCreationInfos()` against a
  live project rather than guessed.
- Openness offers no move or copy operation for blocks and types, so `CopyBlock`, `MoveBlock`,
  `CopyType` and `MoveType` are composed from export, import and - for a move - deleting the
  source after the import succeeds. Two consequences are visible to callers: the object must be
  consistent, and its block number travels with it, so importing into the same PLC can collide.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-07

Upgrade to the current MCP .NET SDK and adopt the newer protocol surface.

### Breaking

- Tool failures are no longer JSON-RPC errors. `ModelContextProtocol` 2.x turns an
  `McpException` thrown from a tool into a `CallToolResult` with `isError: true`, carrying
  the message as text content. Clients that inspected JSON-RPC `error.code` (`InvalidParams`,
  `InternalError`, ...) must read the tool result's `isError` flag and message instead.
  `McpErrorCode` was removed from all 75 throw sites; error codes now live only on the
  derived `McpProtocolException`, which is reserved for protocol-level faults.

### Added

- Environment diagnostics ('doctor'), available two ways: the `--doctor` command line argument
  prints a report and exits without starting the MCP server, and the new `Doctor` tool returns the
  same report plus structured content to MCP clients. Both report the connection state, the open
  project, the active TIA major version, every installed TIA Portal version >= V21 (with a check
  that its Openness assemblies and the Portal executable are present), and membership in the
  `Siemens TIA Openness` user group. Read-only throughout: unlike `Openness.IsUserInGroup`, the
  new `Openness.CheckUserInGroup` never adds the user to the group.
- `Engineering.GetTiaPortalInstallPath(int)` resolves the install path of any TIA major version and
  no longer depends on the `TIAP{version}\TIA_Opns` registry sub key alone - installations that do
  not write that key are now found via their other product sub keys, which carry the same path.

### Changed

- Siemens TIA Portal Openness updated to V21. `Siemens.Collaboration.Net.TiaPortal.Packages.Openness` 20.0.1744190253 -> 21.0.1765349347 and
  `Siemens.Collaboration.Net.TiaPortal.Openness.Resolver` 1.1.1725480302 -> 2.0.1765367256. The default
  TIA major version is now 21 (`Openness.Initialize`, `Program.Main`); older versions remain reachable via
  `--tia-major-version`. `Engineering.Resolver` now also excludes `V21` directories when targeting another
  version, and the test `App.config` probing path points at `Portal V21`. A machine with TIA Portal V21
  Openness installed is now required to build.
- `ModelContextProtocol` 0.3.0-preview.4 -> 2.2.0; `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`
  10.0.0-preview.4 -> 10.0.10. Negotiated protocol revisions are now `2024-11-05`,
  `2025-03-26`, `2025-06-18` and `2025-11-25`.
- `initialize` now reports `serverInfo` (name, title, version) and `instructions` telling the
  client to call `Connect` and `OpenProject` first and how to discover path arguments.
- Progress reporting for `ExportBlocks`, `ExportTypes`, `ExportBlocksAsDocuments` and
  `ImportBlocksFromDocuments` moved from hand-rolled `notifications/progress` calls to the
  SDK-injected `IProgress<ProgressNotificationValue>`. The removed `IMcpServer` and
  `RequestContext<CallToolRequestParams>` parameters were SDK-injected and never part of the
  tool input schemas, so the wire-visible schemas are unchanged. Progress notifications are
  emitted only when the client supplies a `progressToken`, as before; the non-standard
  `Error` field previously sent on failure notifications is gone.
- Tools and prompts are registered explicitly (`WithTools`/`WithPrompts`) instead of by
  assembly scanning, giving a stable `tools/list` order.

### Added

- All 30 tools carry a `title` and behaviour annotations: 13 read-only `Get*` tools are
  `readOnlyHint: true`; project mutations (`SaveProject`, `SaveAsProject`, `CloseProject`),
  all export tools (they overwrite files already present at the target path) and all import tools
  are `destructiveHint: true`. Everything is `openWorldHint: false`.
- The 13 read-only tools publish an `outputSchema` and return `structuredContent`.

### Removed

- `src/TiaMcpServer/packages.config` — a stale packages.config-era leftover pinning
  `ModelContextProtocol` 0.2.0-preview.1. The project has used SDK-style `PackageReference`
  for some time and the build ignored this file.
