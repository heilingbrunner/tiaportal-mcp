# Change Log

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-07

Upgrade to the current MCP .NET SDK and adopt the newer protocol surface.

### Breaking

- Tool failures are no longer JSON-RPC errors. `ModelContextProtocol` 2.x turns an
  `McpException` thrown from a tool into a `CallToolResult` with `isError: true`, carrying
  the message as text content. Clients that inspected JSON-RPC `error.code` (`InvalidParams`,
  `InternalError`, ...) must read the tool result's `isError` flag and message instead.
  `McpErrorCode` was removed from all 75 throw sites; error codes now live only on the
  derived `McpProtocolException`, which is reserved for protocol-level faults.

### Changed

- Siemens TIA Portal Openness updated to V21. `Siemens.Collaboration.Net.TiaPortal.Packages.Openness` 20.0.1744190253 -> 21.0.1765349347 and
  `Siemens.Collaboration.Net.TiaPortal.Openness.Resolver` 1.1.1725480302 -> 2.0.1765367256. The default
  TIA major version is now 21 (`Openness.Initialize`, `Program.Main`); older versions remain reachable via
  `--tia-major-version`. `Engineering.Resolver` now also excludes `V21` directories when targeting another
  version, and the test `App.config` probing path points at `Portal V21`. A machine with TIA Portal V21
  Openness installed is now required to build.
- `ModelContextProtocol` 0.3.0-preview.4 -> 2.2.0; `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`
  10.0.0-preview.4 -> 10.0.10. Negotiated protocol revisions are now `2024-11-05`,
  `2025-03-26`, `2025-06-18` and `2025-11-25`.
- `initialize` now reports `serverInfo` (name, title, version) and `instructions` telling the
  client to call `Connect` and `OpenProject` first and how to discover path arguments.
- Progress reporting for `ExportBlocks`, `ExportTypes`, `ExportBlocksAsDocuments` and
  `ImportBlocksFromDocuments` moved from hand-rolled `notifications/progress` calls to the
  SDK-injected `IProgress<ProgressNotificationValue>`. The removed `IMcpServer` and
  `RequestContext<CallToolRequestParams>` parameters were SDK-injected and never part of the
  tool input schemas, so the wire-visible schemas are unchanged. Progress notifications are
  emitted only when the client supplies a `progressToken`, as before; the non-standard
  `Error` field previously sent on failure notifications is gone.
- Tools and prompts are registered explicitly (`WithTools`/`WithPrompts`) instead of by
  assembly scanning, giving a stable `tools/list` order.

### Added

- All 30 tools carry a `title` and behaviour annotations: 13 read-only `Get*` tools are
  `readOnlyHint: true`; project mutations (`SaveProject`, `SaveAsProject`, `CloseProject`),
  all export tools (they overwrite files already present at the target path) and all import tools
  are `destructiveHint: true`. Everything is `openWorldHint: false`.
- The 13 read-only tools publish an `outputSchema` and return `structuredContent`.

### Removed

- `src/TiaMcpServer/packages.config` — a stale packages.config-era leftover pinning
  `ModelContextProtocol` 0.2.0-preview.1. The project has used SDK-style `PackageReference`
  for some time and the build ignored this file.
